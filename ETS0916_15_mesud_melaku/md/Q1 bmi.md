problem analysis

input(s): the height and weight of the user in meter and kg respectively.

output(s): the body max index of the user  (BMI).

procedure(s): 

--> prompt a message that instructs the user to insert their height and weight

--> Declaring a variables named height,weight,bmi,that holds an input and operation results 

--> read the height and weight of the user

--> calculating the BMI by using the formula: BMI = Weight/Height^2

--> displaying the BMI.
                       
algorithm/psedocode

step 1: start

step 2: read the height and weight of the user

step 3: BMI = (weight/(height^2))

step 4: print BMI

step 5: stop
