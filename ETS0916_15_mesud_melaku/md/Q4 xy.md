problem analysis

input(s): the base and exponent of the function.

output(s): x raise to the power of y(x^y) or the result variable.

procedure(s):

--> variable declartion of x ,y and result

--> prompt a message to instruct the user to enter the base and the exponent

--> read the base and set it to x

--> read the exponent and set it to y

--> calculate x raises by y using the cmath library and store it to a result variable

--> displaying the x^y or the variable called result

algorithm/psedocode

step 1: start

step 2: read the base(x) and the exponent(y) 

step 3: result = x^y

step 4: print result

step 5: stop
